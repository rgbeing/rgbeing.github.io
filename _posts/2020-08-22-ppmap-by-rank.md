## The Era of pp Maps

In the beginning, when peppy created the osu! â€” and osu was without any ambition or motivation, with darkness over the Flashlight and a mighty wind sweeping over the ranking panels.
Then peppy said: "Let there be a *performance point v2*, and there was ppv2.

peppy saw that the ppv2 was good. And limitless competition was followedâ€”the era of pp maps.

At the midst of the storm of pp maps, we all aspires to getting more pp, or making more pp maps.
Although there always have been a critisism that the pp system contaminates the quality of maps and is smothering the diversity of maps, we cannot deny that the pp system and pp maps brought us a new way to enjoy osu.

## PP Map diverges by rank

However, is there exist a map that gives pp to everyone? It might be not, as everyone's skill is different.
So-called pro players are getting enormous amounts of pp from HONESTY or Tsukinami+DT, me and other commoners cannot get pp from such a hard map!

Therefore, pp maps are different from user's ranking. We are now going to find a popular pp map by ranking.

## A Method of The Research

For the research, first I get a list of pp ranking top 10000 players, then compiled their top 100 plays.
Although I could use all top 100 socres in analysis, I decided to use only top 50 scores of user.
Why? Because top 100th score often times does not bring you even a single pp, so it can barely be told as pp map.

I divided users #1-#10000 into four groups: over 3 digits (#1-1000), head of 4 digits (#1001-#3000),
body of 4 digits (#3001-#6000), and tail of 4 digits (#6000-#10000). It's just an arbitrary division!

From data retrieved from osu!api, I found top 100 most frequently observed map in top score of each group.

## Result

I will show only top 5 maps for each division. The full result can be checked in google docs: [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UfXfTRxamcnIYs7uvxr12ezGoD_LWIM5D0WSbL3y-nI/edit?usp=sharing)

Note that mean pp is the mean amount of pp get from users in a division, and max pp is the max amount of pp gotten from users in a division.

### Over 3 digits (#1-1000)

Many legendary maps are on the list. JUSTadICE, Guess Who Is Back, ... Those are a costellation of pp maps! 
And there is a new face, Marshmary. It is so hot as it was ranked only 3 months ago!

### Top of 4 digits (#1001-3000)

chAnge is the most popular pp map in this division, and Bass Slut is found again. Another legendary pp map, Best FriendS is on the 4th place.

### Mid of 4 digits (#3001-6000)

Kimi no Bouken is on the first place, and Black Rover and Snow Halation is followed. 
Another traditional pp map (it was ranked 4 years ago!), Bravely You is on the 4th place, and chAngE is found again.

### Bottom of 4 digits (#6001-10000)

[![4bot-1](/assets/images/ppmap-by-rank/4digits-low/1.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/781509#osu/1655981)
[![4bot-2](/assets/images/ppmap-by-rank/4digits-low/2.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/894883#osu/1869933)
[![4bot-3](/assets/images/ppmap-by-rank/4digits-low/3.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/869019#osu/1816243)
[![4bot-4](/assets/images/ppmap-by-rank/4digits-low/4.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/384772#osu/930249)
[![4bot-5](/assets/images/ppmap-by-rank/4digits-low/5.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/338293#osu/753445)

This is the division that I belong to! I actually cannot understand how people can earn pp from such a big jump in Black Rover and Kimi no Bouken ðŸ˜¢ 
There are other familiar, or even public pp maps, Kani*Do-Luck! and Asu no Yozora Shoukaihan.

## Conclusion

We can notice that pp maps can vary with user's ranking.
I found that top players' pp maps are played with mods (especially HDDT or HDDTHR), while common users can get enough pp for them just in no mod.

How about conquering your division's pp map one by one?
